# SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for managing data in a database: it's only used for one thing: talking to databases. 
Even though SQL has just one purpose, it is used by many different database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or the system we'll be using in this course: SQLite.

Every database system has its own strengths and weaknesses, and as you learn more about them you should evaluate them thoughtfully when deciding which to use for what purpose.

Most of the sites you interact with every day, and consequently most of the sites you'll work on or build, need databases to persist data. We need a way to take our Ruby objects, store them in a database and retrieve them at the appropriate time.
